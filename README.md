## Motivation

Quite often, the need arises to do line editing instead of managing an entire file with a template resource. This cookbook supplies various resources that will help you do this.

## Limitations

- The line resources processes the entire target file in memory. Trying to edit large files may fail.
- The end of line processing was only tested using `\n` and `\r\n`. Using other line endings very well may not work.
- The end of line string used needs to match the actual end of line used in the file `\n` and `\r\n` are used as the defaults but if they don't match the actual end of line used in the file the results will be weird.
- Adding a line implies there is a separator on the previous line. Adding a line differs from appending characters.
- Lines to be added should not contain EOL characters. The providers do not do multiline regex checks.
- Missing file processing is the way it is by intention

  - `add_to_list` do nothing, list not found so there is nothing to add to.
  - `append_if_no_line` create file, add the line.
  - `delete_from_list` do nothing, the list was not found which implies there is nothing to delete
  - `delete_lines` do nothing, the line isn't there which implies there is nothing to delete
  - `replace_or_add` create file, add the line

- Chef client version 13 or greater is expected.

## Resources
